          directly to your device without the need of installing plugins,
          extensions or apps, having specific browsers or operating systems and
          is completely <b>open-source.</b>

          ThunderHub provides a <b>simple and easy to use </b>manager without
          needing to give us any private information. Everything is stored
          directly in your browser and sensitive information (like your admin

        <Text>
          If you connect using your admin macaroon, it is
          <b> AES-256 encrypted, password protected</b> and
          <b> stored only in your browser. </b>
          The password is only known by you and you need to unlock your account
          everytime you want to perform an admin only change such as managing
          channels or sending and receiving bitcoin or lightning payments.

          The ThunderHub server uses your credentials to connect to your node
          but they are never stored outside of your browser. Still, this
          involves a certain degree of trust you must be aware of.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          If you want a more secure alternative, you can connect using a
          view-only macaroon and use ThunderHub only for monitoring your node.

        <Question>What happens if I forget my password?</Question>
        <Text>
          The password is only known by you and is used to unlock an encrypted
          macaroon stored only on your browser making it impossible for us to
          help you with this situation.

        <Text>
          The fix is simple. <b>Delete that account on ThunderHub </b>
          (Don't worry, this doesn't delete anything or affect in any way your
          node) <b>and connect again </b>with your desired macaroons.

        <Question>
          Can I use ThunderHub without having my own Lightning Node?
        </Question>
        <Text>
          ThunderHub provides full lightning node management which is only
          possible when you are the owner of the lightning node to which it is
          connecting. So in short,
          <b> no </b> you cannot use ThunderHub without having your own node.

          Nowadays with the posibility of using pruned bitcoin nodes (Bitcoin
          nodes which only have a section of the Bitcoin blockchain), you can
          get a lightning node up and running in the cloud{' '}
